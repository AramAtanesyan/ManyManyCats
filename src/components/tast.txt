Build a simple React-Redux application which displays images from cat API. Here's the API 
https://docs.thecatapi.com/api-reference

Example URL to fetch 10 cats with category hats: 
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=10&page=1&category_ids=1 
Example URL to fetch the categories: 
https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/categories 
The page is a simple app that loads a sidebar of all categories and  displays 10 cat images in the main display. 
∙ All the categories are clickable - you can click on them and choose a different category ∙ There is a button to load more cat images at the bottom, which will load 10 more cat  images. 
∙ No category is selected by default
∙ The app must be built with react-redux (mobx)
∙ Using react router, typescript is a plus
∙ Don't use any premade UI kit lib, write all styles purely, (SCSS or StyledComponents) 
∙ Aesthetics and clean code are important when building this small prototype. 
∙ Responsive design is a must.
Here's what we will be evaluating when we will review the solution: 
∙ Follows the requirements - app does what is required 
∙ Clean code - there is no dead/commented out code, code is easy to read and understand, well structured 
∙ JS - state handled in redux (mobx), follows common conventions ∙ UI - looks nice and is responsive 
∙ You’ll get extra points by using the React router with lazy loading and Typescript. 

After task completion push the changes to git and send repo link to Dont_Look_Up_777 telegram.
IMPORTANT!!!
if you have problems with pushing to git, try to solve yourself, don’t rush to the mentor for help.
Good luck!
